# BBC News Classification and Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the BBC News Classification ðŸ“° and Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¥ repository! In this project, we aim to classify BBC news articles into five distinct categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. Additionally, we explore the realm of movie recommendation using the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm.

This repo is the final assigment for the course [Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-algorithms-in-machine-learning).

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the application of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques:

1. **BBC News Classification Notebook:**
   - **Objective:** Classify BBC news articles into five categories using supervised learning models.
   - **Dataset:** The data used for this task is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/data).
   - **Approach:** We employ a supervised learning model to achieve accurate categorization, comparing it with an unsupervised learning model, Matrix Factorization. Some NLP techniques are used for the data preprocessing

2. **Movie Recommender System Notebook:**
   - **Objective:** Build a movie recommender system using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm.
   - **Dataset:** We utilize the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/).
   - **Approach:** Addressing the limitations of matrix factorization(NMF), we propose solutions to enhance the movie recommendation system.
